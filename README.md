## Mycomap Batch Data

This is a tool to allow any Mycomap BC contributor generate a CSV file for the batch of submissions.

Tool found here: https://mycomapbc.github.io/batch-csv/

For people currently not using the standard `BCxx-xxxxx` format, they can disable the check by including a `?voucherCheck=false` parameter on the webpage.
